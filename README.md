Its just a normal simple keylogger you can edit it to your hearts content.
Windows antivirus will detect this and thats because its a keylogger 
It will create a file named "log.txt" in the directory of the Keylogger this doesn't connect or give out data, Me as a developer strongly disagree with unethical hacking

Have Fun!
