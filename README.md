Its just a normal simple keylogger you can edit it to your hearts content.! 😎📒

(❁´◡`❁)

Windows antivirus will detect this and thats because its a keylogger 👌👌😘
It will create a file named "log.txt" in the directory of the Keylogger this doesn't connect or give out data, Me as a developer strongly disagree with unethical hacking😊

**--To Stop The Keylogger--**

Either restart OR follow these steps press Left-Ctrl, Shift and Esc at the same time, look for Details, click it then scroll down till you see "Keylogger.exe", click it then click End Task and End Process, Done!

Have Fun!
